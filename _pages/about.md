I am a third-year Electrical and Systems Engineering PhD student at University of Pennsylvania, supervised by Prof. René Vidal. I am supported by Dean’s Fellow at UPenn and NSF Graduate Research Fellow. I received my BA in Applied Mathematics from University of California, Berkeley, and was a machine learning researcher at Lawrence Livermore National Lab. 

My research interests center on the development of trustworthy machine learning systems. I build frameworks and algorithms that imposes well-structured assumptions about the data, enforces the use of interpretable features, and generate human-aligned explanations. From small-scale medical problems to large-scale multi-modal challenges, the goal is to not only understand modern deep learning on both theoretical and practical fronts, but also make implementable, accessible, and intuitive to those who rely on such systems. 

Feel free to contact me for potential collaborations and discussions.
