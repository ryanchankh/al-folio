## Looking for Ambitious Students!
I would not be here today if I did not have a series of truly amazing and inspiring mentors along the way. Since the beginning, my success is largely attributed to the teachers and friends who guided me. To pay it forward, I am open to mentor young and up-and-coming talents for interesting research projects, as well as struggling students who want some simple life advice. To contact me, please reach out via email.


### My Teaching and Mentoring Experience
I have tutored and mentored students from all ages:
- K1-K12: I was a math tutor at mathnasium, teaching kids basic math skills from pre-algebra to calculus
- High School: I was a tutor for students who did not pass the California High School Exit Exam (CAHSEE). I was also the tutor for senior students struggling in AP Calculus AB and BC. In fact, my year was the first year in Mrs. Bulgin's (my math teacher at the time) years of teaching to have 100% passing rate of the AP Calculus BC Exam. 
- College: I was the math tutor at the Math Resource Center at Pasadena City College (Later changed name to Math Success Center). I was also actively involved in student government, meeting deans and voting on curriculum changes (committee also known as Curriculum and Instruction).
- PhD: I am part of UPenn's Graduate School Mentoring Initiative (GSMI), and mentor undergraduate students in preparation of applying to graduate school and the preparing of potential challenges. 


### Remarks
- Feel free to email on research and professional advice, such as applying for NSF GRFP.
- Community College has largely shaped the foundation of who I am today. To those who are deciding between 4-year university or 2-year community college then transfer, I am a strong advocate of the latter.
