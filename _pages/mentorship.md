## Find Me!
I would not be here today if I did not have a series of truly amazing and inspiring mentors along the way. My currently success is largely attributed to the teachers and friends who guided me conditionally. To pay it forward, I am open to mentor young and up-and-coming talents for interesting research projects, as well as struggling students who want some simple life advice. To contact me, please reach out via email.


### My Teaching and Mentoring Experience
I have tutored and mentored students from all ages:
- K1-K12: I was a math tutor at mathnasium, teaching kids basic math skills from pre-algebra to calculus
- High School: I was a tutor for students who did not pass the California High School Exit Exam (CAHSEE). I was also the tutor for senior students struggling in AP Calculus AB and BC.
- College: I was the math tutor at the Math Resource Center at Pasadena City College (Later changed name to Math Success Center). I was also actively involved in student government, meeting deans and voting on curriculum changes (committee also known as Curriculum and Instruction).
- PhD: I am part of UPenn's Graduate School Mentoring Initiative (GSMI), and mentor undergraduate students in applying to graduate school and finding research directions. 


### Remarks
- I am also happy to provide tips on applying for NSF GRFP and related fellowships/scholarships.
- Community College has largely shaped the foundation of who I am today. To those who are deciding between 4-year university or 2-year community college then transfer, I am a strong advocate of the latter.
